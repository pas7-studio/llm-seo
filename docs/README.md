# Documentation

`@pas7/llm-seo` documentation index.

## Core Docs

- [`format.md`](./format.md): `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt` structure and deterministic rules.
- [`config.md`](./config.md): full config schema and validation behavior.
- [`policies.md`](./policies.md): geo policy, citations, restricted claims.
- [`ci.md`](./ci.md): CI usage, exit codes, fail strategies.
- [`nextjs.md`](./nextjs.md): Next.js and static export integration.

## Notes

- The source of truth for current capabilities is the code and tests in `src/` and `test/`.
- Legacy examples in older docs should be treated as illustrative unless they match current CLI help.
